\section{Linear Regression Example\label{Linear Regression Example}}
The example below uses only the first feature of the \verb|diabetes| dataset, in order to illustrate the data points within the two-dimensional plot. The straight line can be seen in the plot, showing how linear regression attempts to draw a straight line that will best minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation.

The coefficients, residual sum of squares and the coefficient of determination are also calculated.


\section{Non-negative least squares\label{Non-negative least squares}}
In this example, we fit a linear model with positive constraints on the regression coefficients and compare the estimated coefficients to a classic linear regression.
